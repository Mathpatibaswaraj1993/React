In React, props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

Key Points about Props:
Read-only: Props are immutable in the child component. The child can use them but cannot modify them.

Passed via JSX attributes: Props are passed to components using attributes in JSX.

Example:
jsx
Copy
Edit
// Parent Component
function App() {
  return <Greeting name="Alice" />;
}

// Child Component
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
In this example:

The App component passes a name prop to the Greeting component.

The Greeting component accesses it using props.name.

Destructuring Props (Cleaner Syntax):
jsx
Copy
Edit
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
Why Use Props?
Props help make components reusable and dynamic by allowing you to customize their output based on data passed in.
